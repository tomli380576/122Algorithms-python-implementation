# ECS 122A Algorithms: Python Implementation

My implementations of all the fundamental algorithms covered in ECS122A

They are referenced in this [**Notion Document**](https://zhongning-tommy-li.notion.site/Algorithms-122AB-baebf66e9a614361aa02360592be8e0b)

Note that some of the graph algorithms references graphs in the **`example_unweighted_graphs.py`** file. Make sure the algorithm file and the graph file are in the same directory

## System Requirements

Python 3.8+
